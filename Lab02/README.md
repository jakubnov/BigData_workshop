# Lab2: Schedule a Hive query

## Lab goal: 
Once done, user will be able to schedule Hive query within Hue with help of Oozie. 

### Step1: Create a table for storing results
It's important to have a table where data from scheduled runs will be stored. Therefore is need to create a table: 

> CREATE TABLE 202002_workshop.jno_scheduler_output <br>
> ( <br>
> Incremental_ID INT, <br> 
> time TIMESTAMP <br> 
> ) <br>
> STORED AS PARQUET; 

Not important in this step, but better to do that - refresh metadata after creation of the table. In case you write code in Hive, there is no need to run following command, just for Impala: 

> REFRESH 202002_workshop.jno_scheduler_output; 


### Step 2: Create and save a Hive query
Since we have created a table into that result of schedulled query will be saved, we can prepare some sample query. Let's have e.g.

> INSERT INTO 202002_workshop.jno_scheduler_output <br>
> SELECT cast(nvl(max(incremental_id),1)+1 as int), current_timestamp() FROM 202002_workshop.jno_scheduler_output; <br>

and hit save the query. Have only this query in the query window. 

<b> Check your timezone: </b> In Impala run query that will informs you about timezone set for cluster. Will be needed later during schedulling.

> select timeofday();

### Step 3: Create workflow
Open Scheduler - Worflow and create new workflow: drag and drop Hive query. 

Save the schedule under your name e.g. JNO_schedule_test_202002

<i> Note: It's important to change Actions into Documents. Hive query isn't available in Actions. </i>

### Step 4: Schedule query
Open Scheduler - Schedule </br>
Define new schedule: add workflow you created in the previous step and set scheduler. </br>

<b> Important parts to setup: </b>
* Check Advanced settings
* Crontab set as * * * * *  (5 stars) - query will run each minute
* Set Timezone as "Europe/Prague" 
* From / To withtin the same day, e.g. for about an hour interval

<b> Save the schedule, commit it and run without dryrun. </b>


<b> Crontab help: </b> </br>
* 1st possition: Minute (0-59) </br>
* 2nd possition: Hour (0-23)</br>
* 3rd possition: Day of month (1-31) </br>
* 4th possition: Month of year (1-12) </br>
* 5th possition: Day of week (0-7) 0 and 7 are Sundays </br>
* e.g. * 16-17 * * *  -> query will run each day, each minute between 16-17 hour (4-5pm). 
               
### Step 5: Check results
First step is to refresh medata in case you didn't add REFRESH databasename.tablename at the end of scheduled script.

Run:
> REFRESH 202002_workshop.jno_scheduler_output; 

Now you are able to select your data in table. Run: 
> SELECT * FROM 202002_workshop.jno_scheduler_output;
